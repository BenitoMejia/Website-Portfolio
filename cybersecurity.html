            <p class="mb-3">
              Since the introduction of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, all aspects of manufacturing have become computerized. Therefore, it is essential that everyone involved becomes knowledgeable in computing in general and computer security specifically, as the adoption of robotics, IoT Technology, and automation has provided hackers with new opportunities to attack. Cybersecurity is crucial in manufacturing as it helps protect intellectual property and sensitive data, maintain supply chain integrity, and prevent operational disruptions.

            <h3 class="h5">What is Cybersecurity?</h3>
            <p class="mb-0">
                Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting critical systems and sensitive information from digital attacks. Also known as information technology (IT) security, cybersecurity measures are designed to combat threats against networked systems, data, and applications, whether those threats originate from inside or outside of an organization. Cybersecurity is not just an IT function and responsibility; it is People, Process, and Technology.
