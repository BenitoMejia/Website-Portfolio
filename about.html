            <h3 class="h5">Hobbies</h3>
            <p class="mb-0">I have a passion for automobiles, specifically car modifying. Many people view cars as a simple means of transportation to get from point A to point B, but I prefer to see them as an extension of the owner. A car can be a canvas where you can express yourself, make a statement, or make yourself known.</p>

Advanced PCB is a printed circuit board manufacturing and assembly facility located in Aurora CO, that specializes in fabricating PCBs from scratch and also populating them with chips and components. We work with many commercial, medical, aerospace, and military companies, so it is key that the boards we produce are built correctly so they can perform as intended in the field.</p>
